        <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <i><b>headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
        quotes, and other items.</b></i><br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u>angle brackets</u>. Tags
        such as <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. <br>
        Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements. <br> Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content
        of the page.
